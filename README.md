# TTB2020: Vesta 

Hello! Weâ€™re Shannon, Vivian, and Pauline and our app is called Vesta, named after the Roman goddess of the hearth. With this app, we hope to raise awareness about how climate-change induced extreme weather phenomena can lead to intensified wildfire patterns.

For the Prediction section, here are examples of coordinates to try:
(38.5038, -122.8102)
