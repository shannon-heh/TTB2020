                We are three students from Northern California who have been indirectly
                affected by the catastrophic wildfires that have been ravaging California for
                the past couple of years. We decided to connect this to climate change because
                we have personally observed the extreme weather patterns and temperature extremes
                with the worsening of Northern California wildfires.

                Disclaimer: Due to time constraints, we have only featured three counties in Northern
                California that have been especially ravaged by wildfires in recent years. We hope
                to expand the number of counties and states included with time.
